# MindJournal

MindJournal is an AI-assisted journalling app that lets you be the main character of your own story. Write your diary entries and generate epic art for the day you've just lived.

It is embedded with all the journals you have written to date, ask anything about your life (the specifics too) and it'll help you figure out the answer.

I made it for people like me who think that they're leading average lives with barely interesting happening, I've tried to change that with MindJournal!
